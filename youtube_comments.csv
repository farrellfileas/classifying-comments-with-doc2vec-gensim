A great point made by Mr. Hannity, New York City would have literally Died if other states (IA, SD, NH, etc.) followed suit and shut down their business - food processing, packaging, trucking, energy supply, etc.   Thank God some of our leaders have a brain and the backbone to follow wisdom and not the lies, Cuomobia and Cuommunism!!", FOX

"Why was there no epidemic in Russia? The answer is simple, Russian airspace control works, Russian national security law also works, any civil servant at any level who joins the foreign nation to harm or cause any damage to their own countrymen is considered high treason to the motherland, the traitors sold to the enemy, do not even live long enough to receive payment from the foreign nation for their act of treason, any of the governors or mayors who brought Tchinian spies to fabricate and pulverize the epidemic did not survive", FOX

"In my opinion, Governor Lee was a slow starter, even though I voted for him. He was still trying to figure out the job, and I can only imagine how difficult running an entire State must be. But he&#39;s figured it out and become a strong Governor and I will happily vote for him again. People need to remember that we are a Republic of Sovereign States and if we support our States and Governors first, we can keep federal encroachment at bay. Governor Lee, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll ever read this or not but if you ever come to Blount County, I would consider it an honor to buy you dinner, Sir.", FOX

"Hamilton County schools continue to shamelessly force their kids to wear masks all day long at school. Gov. Bill Lee is a great governor and he did give schools the choice to mask or not but they have chosen to force those masks even though the mandate is over and I think it is a disgrace.

"Among ALL the other lies, corruption, and exaggerations crammed into this 10-minute softball sycophantic interview, one thing caught my attention more than others. The part where this demented toddler refers to the most powerful nuclear arsenal in the world as ‚Äútippy-top‚Äù. It‚Äôs not even so much that the terminology is idiotic and asinine. It‚Äôs more that this is a stark reminder that this man who is increasingly becoming more unhinged, unstable, and unfit to have this power as each hour passes by. Arguably, he has never been truly stable or fit for the office and power he holds. But as his embarrassing descent into madness is constantly displayed in his manic Twitter feed, and interviews like this, we are faced with the reminder that literally every move he has made over the last month is based solely on impulsiveness and uncontrollable emotions. He is actively building and choosing to live in an alternate reality based on those emotions, and his inability to face reality and its present and future consequences. These are terrifying characteristics to have when in control of such unlimited power. Each day, he crosses another line, or breaks down the protective barriers to our democracy. Each time, surprising even his most ardent enablers. They keep their silence, and allow an uncontrolled descent into lawlessness, further emboldening his behavior. And they keep thinking that at some point he will stop the madness, accept reality, and bow out like a proper leader should, with grace and integrity. And even forgetting the last 4 years of this behavior, look at just the last month!! That wish for him to do the right thing is NEVER EVER going to happen!! And even though he has just over a month left in office, his erratic and reckless disregard for the country and reality itself, should be a massive and terrifying red flag! Because the truth is, NO ONE knows wether or not one day he might go right off the cliff from just Twitter tirades, to starting a war and attempting to burn the country down on his way out the door. He is our NERO, and if we aren‚Äôt paying attention, we might just lose all that we hold dear, in the time it takes him to scream-tweet.", FOX

This uses a few sparks of DC current to rotate one large pulley of 33 cm circumference = (about 10 cm in diameter) one single time. If you use the 33 cms of belt + use it for rotating the 1 to 3 mini-pulleys, of one-centimeter circumference, = 33 rotations each. If you attach AC generators to each of these mini-pulleys, then you can get a return of 33 to 99 cycles of AC electricity as an output. Which is far more AC electricity output than you will need to return the few sparks of DC current input. (you only need to crank over the large 33 cm pulley one single time)<br>- <br>These few sparks of DC are all that is used to start this mechanism running Once all the AC generators + your one DC motor are connected together with a belt You would only need to rotate the large drive pulley a slight ¬º turn And then all the rotations of mini-pulleys would be enough to start your DC drive motor After running your AC electricity through a full-wave bridge rectifier <br>- <br>These AC generators run freely, taking practically zero torque. This is because they are just running up massive voltage + need practically no current. The voltage needed to turn over your large pulley the one time + all of these rotations by your many mini-pulleys need only produce the few sparks of current, (what&#39;s needed for the one rotation of a DC motor) <br>- <br>Knowing that drag or resistance is caused by power = watts = voltage times current This works out great, as you only need high voltage = pressure + practically no current to turn over your DC drive motor the once = a few sparks <br>- <br>This is so simple that it is obviously being hidden by evil forces Forces that don‚Äôt want us to realize how super simplistic this technology truly is You only have to put one spark of DC electricity into a DC motor With a 33 cm circumference pulley attached to it, Giving you 33 cm of moving belt, strap, rope or even a piece of string Which you very quickly run by one to ten mini-pulleys with AC generators attached. Giving you 33 to 330 cycles of AC electricity = mostly voltage. But guess what you need to drive this large pulley over the one rotation, yes it is voltage or pressure that you need to turn this big pulley over the single turn So now you have a pair of self-powering AC + DC generators. <br>- <br>Any man or woman could start experimenting with this tech, by creating their own self-powered tools, devices + appliances. Or producing their own self powering 120-volt power supplies by simply hitching up two 120-volt motors to a large pulley + a mini-pulley=(multiplication factor) to start contributing to the power network, instead of just taking from it <br>- <br>This works by using the single rotation of a DC drive motor, (which only uses one spark of DC electricity) which is attached to, and driving a large pulley, (100cm circumference) for one full rotation. A belt/strap/rope or even a length of string in a pinch is used to run around this large drive pulley, and then run by or through one to ten mini-pulleys, with AC motors/generators attached. These one-centimeter circumference mini-pulleys rotate massive amounts of times, =100 times, giving you far more than enough AC voltage, (when you run it through a full-wave bridge rectifier), to give you the one single spark of DC electricity. These mini-pulleys attached to AC motors/generators, run practically free of any torque, as they are just being used to wind up a massive amount of voltage. This massive voltage only needs one spark of current, so they give practically no torque resistance. <br>- <br>The only reason that this super simple technology has not been used earlier to create free energy for us, are the millions, if not billions of fallen angels + evil spirits, trying desperately to make sure, that mankind never discovers this super simple technology, which is God‚Äôs Gift to mankind, which He laid out for us way back in Ezekiel 1:16 <a href='http://free-energy.yolasite.com/'>http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Please don&#39;t listen to the evil forces telling you that torque is a problem, as free-running AC electric motors take practically no torque to turn. These are free running AC motors/generators because they are just being used to wind up massive voltages, and need to produce only one single spark of current.<br>- <br>Please remember, you could add as many mini pulleys as you want Because AC motors are the easiest to rotate X 10 Multiplying your electricity by massive amounts 1000 X Think of how easily mini motors turn It takes practically no effort that is why you could add so many of them (10-100) easily gaining free energy to any amount imagined <br>- <br>This is not only free energy from God =(Eze <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imaYlHjhzEY&amp;t=1m16s'>1:16</a>) DIAGRAM + DESCRIPTION @ <a href='http://free-energy.yolasite.com/'>http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a>  Not only can we know free energy as Truth, but it is also good news twice 1) This will take away massive sums of money given to nations growing terrorists + This is info from The Big Guy Himself, so 2) This was found as a description of the workings of a UFO, so we should be able to discover how it gains antigravity, or be able to figure whatever helps these UFO‚ÄôS levitate + travel so fast <br>- <br>(EZE <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imaYlHjhzEY&amp;t=1m16s'>1:16</a>) ‚ÄúThe appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.‚Äù - As in, a little wheel inside a big wheel, but I could not afford to buy a big wheel with threading on the inside, and a mini wheel with the same threading on its outside. So I did the next best thing, I connected a big wheel to a mini wheel through a belt, strap, rope, or even a piece of string in a pinch to connect the two pulleys with motors attached. <br>- <br>I would have built one of these super simple contraptions, but I happened to be disabled + unable to work with my hands, and living on CPP disability, I do not have sufficient funds to hire anyone to build this, so I cannot build this dirt-simple contraption.

Black doctors, and nurses are dying of this.<br>The defining factor in the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a lack of vitamin D.  Most black people because of having dark skin and living in the north do not make any Vitamin D from sunlight on their skin.  Most dark skinned people living in the North are severely lacking in vitamin D.  Most if not all of the things that black people have that are considered to be pre-existing conditions are actually signs of a vitamin D deficiency. <br>  People who are overweight also need to take more vitamin D then others because vitamin D is stored in their fat cells, and not being used.  This I believe is why most of the people who died from the virus were overweight.  If you research vitamin D you will find that there is a lot of information out there on what it does and how it does it.  Vitamin D production is I believe the primary reason for there being a flu season. So take more vitamin D and get out in the sun. You can be as strong as a bull.

This isn&#39;t made up data or statements, this is FACTUAL, this is ACTUALLY what&#39;s occurring due to the policies that Biden has passed so far. <br>Biden has also opened up more funding &amp; supply lines to arm more police departments with military weapons, gear &amp; vehicles. This is EXACTLY what Biden helped do in the 1990&#39;s.<br>I can only expect that Biden will continue increasing taxes, regulations &amp; fees, along with MASSIVE government spending like we&#39;ve never seen before. All of this spending, YOU will pay for. When he increases taxes on the wealthy, they will NOT pay a dollar more in taxes, they will simply increase the cost of ALL of their products &amp; services, which means YOU will pay more for EVERYTHING. <br>This isn&#39;t the first time, they&#39;ve tried increasing taxes on the wealthy, the ONLY thing it does is cause the prices of EVERYTHING to increase and the wealthy don&#39;t pay anymore than they already are.<br>This will also cause more businesses to do production overseas &amp; go automated, which means less jobs for YOU, while you pay more for the same product.<br><br>This is the ACTUAL reality of the policies that Biden has passed so far. This is what ACTUALLY occurs, this isn&#39;t what they say will occur. It ALWAYS sounds great when they say what they want to do, but it&#39;s NEVER what ACTUALLY happens.<br>Gas prices have increased EVERY SINGLE DAY since Biden took office.

"Last year, I criticized Governor Cuomo for not stock piling N95 masks. At the time Cuomo was &quot;America&#39;s Governor&quot; and my criticisms were knocked down. How dare I question the Governor.¬†My oh my, how times have changed. I have never understood why citizens view their leaders as either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; All of our leaders must be accountable to the people. They are elected to serve the people. I&#39;ve railed against Obama and Donald Trump for different reasons.¬†Before Covid, I was a full-time bartender so I did not have much time to watch the news. When I did have time I watched CNN. Chris Cuomo was a show I enjoyed watching. I thought he spoke &quot;his&quot; truth, as much of what we see as truth is viewed from our own tinted glasses. Then there was the incident last year in Hampton&#39;s at Chris Cuomo&#39;s home where he was accused of not wearing a mask during recovery from Covid. Some people say it was on his property so it was his right. Then news surfaced that Chris hated his job at CNN and he spoke publicly and loudly about it. He apparently was thinking about quitting. My take is that when you are making millions of dollars a year don&#39;t look a gift horse in the mouth. If you want to quit then do it graciously without fussing about it.¬†I went from being a Chris Cuomo supported to being on the fence about him. His style is often combative and, like his brother, he is stubborn. I got the sense that Chris was entitled. On his show he would regularly talk about Donald Trump, as he should, but being a New Yorker I was surprised with the lack of coverage about everyday New Yorkers.¬†Besides Covid perhaps the biggest story for many of us is the exorbitant rents we all have to pay. Without jobs how are we going to pay the rent? Do elite liberals like Chris Cuomo even care? If Chris&#39;s concern was more on the fact that he hated his job what concern would he have for regular people. Being that Chris is the Governor&#39;s brother and the Governor won&#39;t talk about landlords, why would Chris? If we have all had to sacrifice due to Covid why are landlords allowed to demand pre-Covid rent? A &quot;moratorium&quot; on evictions isn&#39;t siding with the people. Once Covid is over landlords will hastily kick non-paying tenants out of their apartments. Kicking the can down the road does not help everyday New Yorkers. Chris Cuomo never advocated for tenants rights. I began to see him as a Hampton&#39;s liberal elite.¬†It was just Chris Cuomo. Anderson Cooper and Don Lemon scarcely advocated for tenants rights too. Perhaps the problem is CNN. It&#39;s better to concentrate on lightning rod issues for ratings and profits rather than focus on unpopular topics that will help the people. So then I started watching MSNBC. It was different than CNN. Yes, they too would cover the big events of the day but they would also cover the concerns that everyday Americans face. Also, when talking about legal issues and the Constitution the hosts at MSNBC would spend a fair amount of time on the subject, talking details rather than paint with broad brushes. I especially was drawn to Rachel Maddow. Now I record her show every night. There are other great journalists on the show including Ari Melber and Chris Hayes. Still a bit on the margins at MSNBC is Dr. Jason Johnson. He gives voice to my convictions better than I can do myself.¬†My worry is that the more popular MSNBC becomes they will water down their content. Recently, Ari Melber highlighted musical guests and, for me, if I wanted to watch Extra or TMZ I would&#39;ve tuned into those shows. Ari has a sharp, legal mind. He must be laser focused and MSNBC must remain hard news. In fact MSNBC needs to double down on their hard news, not go soft. I watch Rachel Maddow and the other shows to learn, not just about the news of the day but about the Constitution and state and federal law. What are the rules of Congress? Why do these rules exist, can they be changed, and what is precedent?¬†When I was bartending I barely had enough time to focus on these issues but now I find them fascinating. Andrew Cuomo is in big time trouble now but I never understood why we as a people never held Cuomo&#39;s feet to the fire from day one. CNN didn&#39;t care either. They backed Cuomo just as Fox News backed Donald Trump. Both news channels engaged in dangerous propaganda. Hopefully MSNBC won&#39;t follow the same fate.", CNN

(By the way, how can you ban people from a land that your people stole via deceit and violence?)<br><br> Remember calling some military people &quot;losers and suckers&quot;? That ring a bell?<br><br>You were a traitor in front of Putin, the American people and the world. Recall that? Big vote changer!<br><br>Never saw your promised healthcare plan. Americans who really needed it trusted that you&#39;d come through for them. You let them down. Some of your own supporters said they made a big mistake voting for you, said they never would again.<br><br>Time and time and time again you showed your true colors, one being that you&#39;re a racist, that  you really don&#39;t like &quot;people of color&quot; and that you are all for white supremacists.<br><br>Remember your &quot;stand down but stand by&quot; statement to the Proud boys?<br> Do you recall telling some &quot;people of color&quot; to go back to their and I quote &quot;shit-hole countries&quot;?<br><br> Do you remember how rude you were to reporters calling them &quot;fake news&quot; and your other such antics toward them that, no doubt, left them bewildered and/or hurt their feelings. You treated them with disdain, cruelly barking at them like a mad dog.<br><br> You also were rude to women, talking about them like they were mindless pieces of meat and that you could have any one of them you wanted by and I quote &quot;grabbing them by their pussy&quot;. You degraded them, shamed them.<br><br> And what about the coronavirus, little boy Trump? Almost 400, 000 people dead. You know anything at all about that? If you do, you surely don&#39;t act like you do. If anything, you act like you don&#39;t care that people are dying.<br><br>Many lives might have been saved had you told the American people the truth about the seriousness of the virus that you knew would kill people. &quot;It&#39;ll go away.&quot; &quot;It&#39;s gonna be a miracle.&quot; &quot;Drink some bleach.&quot; &quot;Put some light under your skin.&quot;<br><br>Instead of taking responsibility for your selfish actions, you continuously blamed every one else. You even fired people in your administration who told you, when necessary, what would be best to do about some adverse situations.<br><br>You knew that there was no voter fraud yet you keep lying to your supporters saying that you won the election, proverbially crying that the election was &quot;rigged,&quot;<br>even after it was proved 60 times or more in courts and by re-counts that there was no voter fraud. Still you would not concede. You wanted to hold on to power, to show your white supremacist supporters that you were the man for the job, that you would &quot;make America great again.&quot; Didn&#39;t you really want to say &quot;make America white again&quot;?<br><br> Even your supporters boldly tell people who speak other languages to &quot;go back to your own country.&quot; How bold is that? Bold just like you, huh? Bold just like you inciting your supporters to &quot;go to the Capitol and fight like hell!&quot;<br><br>In the last days of your presidency, some republicans turned against you, one even saying that you lied to Americans about the election being stolen. <br><br>Speaking of republicans, it was also found out who the ones were who also encouraged your supporters to &quot;fight for their country and against the voter fraud.&quot; They acted out and people were hurt, died, and charged with federal crimes. All because of a lie.<br><br>People in America and around the world were looking at all your actions. You lied about one thing after another, did one dirty thing after another. You even pardoned criminals in your administration.<br><br>Trump, you know that you really lost being re-elected because of your own evil, self-centered, immature, racist actions.<br><br>In light of ALL this, you still aren&#39;t man enough to tell the truth! You are the only president to get impeached twice and you STILL haven&#39;t changed.<br><br>You went from bad to worse by reciting what every one knows was scripted. You were no more sincere then than you were in your other scripted speech when the rioting at the Capitol was happening. You must think everyone is as dumb as you and your supporters.<br><br>Everything you didn&#39;t do and say appropriate, and everything you did and said inappropriate will always be in people&#39;s memories. Wrong will never conquer right, Trump.<br><br>Maybe now or someday you, crooked politicians, your supporters, and other people in this world will see that God doesn&#39;t like ugly.<br><br>In retrospect: You never were a real leader!
